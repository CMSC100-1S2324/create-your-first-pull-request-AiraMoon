I anticipate finally breaking free from this course. 
This marks my nth attempt, as each time I've been compelled to apply for a Leave of Absence mid-semester. 
It's become somewhat of a curse, one I'm eager to shake off. 
Though it may sound harsh and indifferent, my true desire is to glean valuable insights from this subject, as becoming a full-stack developer is a career path I'm seriously considering. 
The allure lies in its high demand, lucrative pay scale, and, most importantly, the potential for a work-from-home arrangement. 
These are the expectations I've set for myself in this course.


I harbor few expectations regarding the exercises, exams, or projects. 
It is what it is. 
My only hope is that the projects or exercises are conducive to home-based work, given that my trusty laptop is hanging by a thread. 
I kid you not; it blue screens at the slightest provocation.


As for the professors, I hold no specific expectations, to be honest. 
Within the classroom, they assume the roles of judge, jury, and executioner simultaneously. 
It's our responsibility as students to adapt, learn, and comply. 
While it's essential to recognize that teaching is their duty or passion, learning is a two-way street. 
Professors are, after all, human beings. 
Therefore, the outcome, i.e., the grades, is a direct result of our efforts and knowledge. 
It isn't solely contingent on the professor's teaching abilities, although that's a contributing factor. 
With a plethora of external resources available, what's taught within these classroom walls is merely a drop in the vast ocean of information. 
So, no pressure, Sir Carl.


Lastly, in terms of my fellow classmates, I hope we all enjoy and excel in this course. 
Based on our introductions, it seems we're off to a promising start. 
Nothing reassures a student more than hearing, "I feel the same way." 
In our interconnected world, I welcome all forms of interaction from my fellow iskos and iskas, within the bounds of respect, of course. 
I pledge to contribute meaningfully and hope that you all will do the same. 
As we forge ahead on our respective life paths, let's ensure we can look back and say we had fun and learned from one another.


Hello, Aira! I agree with all your points of how a career in full-stack development is especially ideal in our ever-changing and modernizing society. 
Your learnings in CMSC 100 will greatly help in that regard. I admire your persevering spirit and I pray that you have the strength to finally reach 
the finish line in passing this course this time around. Wishing you all the best!
